          <article>
            <ul>
              <li>A Microprocessor is an important part of a computer architecture without which you will 
                not be able to perform anything on your computer.</li>
                <li>It is a programmable device that takes in input performs some arithmetic and 
                    logical operations over it and produces the desired output.</li>
                    <li>In simple words, a Microprocessor is a digital device on a chip that 
                        can fetch instructions from memory, decode and execute them and give results.</li>
                        <li>A Microprocessor takes a bunch of instructions in machine language and executes them, telling the processor what it has to do.</li>
                        <li>Microprocessor performs three basic things while executing the instruction: 
                        </li>
                        <ol>
                            <li>It performs some basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and some logical operations using its Arithmetic and Logical Unit (ALU). New Microprocessors also perform operations on floating-point numbers also. </li>
                            <li>Data in microprocessors can move from one location to another. </li>
                            <li>It has a Program Counter (PC) register that stores the address of the next instruction based on the value of the PC, Microprocessor jumps from one location to another and takes decisions. </li>

                        </ol>
                        <li>A microprocessor also has lines for controlling the input and output devices. These devices could be an electric motor or a display lamp or other electronic devices.</li>
                        <li>A typical Microprocessor structure looks like this :</li>

        <h2>5. Basic Terms used in Microprocessor:</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><p style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>Instruction Set</strong>- The group of commands that the microprocessor can understand is called Instruction set. It is an interface between hardware and software.</p></li>
        <li><p style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>Bus</strong>- Set of conductors intended to transmit data, address or control information to different elements in a microprocessor. A microprocessor will have three types of buses, i.e., data bus, address bus, and control bus.</p></li>
        <li><p style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>IPC (Instructions Per Cycle)</strong>- It is a measure of how many instructions a CPU is capable of executing in a single clock.</p>          <li><p style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>Clock Speed</strong>- It is the number of operations per second the processor can perform. It can be expressed in megahertz (MHz) or gigahertz (GHz). It is also called the Clock Rate.</p></li>
        <li><p style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>Bandwidth</strong>- The number of bits processed in a single instruction is called Bandwidth.</p></li>
        <li> <p style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>Word Length </strong>- The number of bits the processor can process at a time is called the word length of the processor. 8-bit Microprocessor may process 8 -bit data at a time. The range of word length is from 4 bits to 64 bits depending upon the type of the microcomputer.</p></li>
        <li> <p style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>Data Types</strong>- The microprocessor supports multiple data type formats like binary, ASCII, signed and unsigned numbers.</p></li>

        <h2>6. Working of Microprocessor:</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><p style="font-size: 20px;">The microprocessor follows a sequence to execute the instruction: Fetch, Decode, and then Execute.</p></li>
        <li><p style="font-size: 20px;">Initially, the instructions are stored in the storage memory of the computer in sequential order. 
        <li><p style="font-size: 20px;">The microprocessor fetches those instructions from the stored area (memory), then decodes it and executes those instructions till STOP instruction is met.</p></li> 
        <li><p style="font-size: 20px;">Then, it sends the result in binary form to the output port. </p></li>
        <li><p style="font-size: 20px;">Between these processes, the register stores the temporary data and ALU (Arithmetic and Logic Unit) performs the computing functions.</p></li>

        <li><p><strong>Small Size </strong>- A microprocessor is fabricated in a very less footprint due to very large scale and ultra large scale integration technology. Because of this, the size of the computer system is reduced.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Versatile </strong>- The same chip can be used for several applications, therefore, microprocessors are versatile.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Reliable</strong>- Since microprocessors use semiconductor technology, therefore, the failure rate is very less. Hence it is very reliable.</p></li>
