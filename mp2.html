          <article>
            <ul>
            <li>The Intel 8085 is an 8-bit microprocessor introduced by Intel in 1977. </li>
            <li>It 
                was binary compatible with the more-famous Intel 8080 but required less 
                supporting hardware, thus allowing simpler and less expensive microcomputer 
                systems to be built.</li>
            <li>The "5" in the model number came from the fact that the 
                    8085 requires only a +5-Volt (V) power supply rather than the +5 V, −5 V and 
                    +12 V supplies the 8080 needed.</li>
            <li>The main features of 8085 Microprocessor are:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>It is an 8-bit microprocessor. </li>
                <li> It is manufactured with N-MOS technology. </li>
                <li>The first 8 lines of address bus and 8 lines of data bus are
                    multiplexed AD0-AD7
                    </li>
                <li>Data bus is a group of 8 lines D0-D7.</li>
                <li>It supports external interrupt request.</li>
                <li>A 16-bit program counter (PC) and a 16-bit stack pointer (SP). </li>
                <li>It is enclosed with 40 pins DIP (Dual in line package).</li>
                <li>It requires a signal +5V power supply and operates at 3.2 MHZ 
                    single phase clock. </li>
            </ul>

            <h1>2. 8085 Architecture:</h1>
            <p>8085 consists of various units as shown in Fig. 1 and each unit performs its 
                own functions. The various units of a microprocessor are listed below</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Accumulator</li>
                    <li>Arithmetic and logic Unit</li>
                    <li>General purpose register</li>
                    <li> Program counter</li>
                    <li> Stack pointer</li>
                    <li> Temporary register
                    </li>
                    <li>Flags</li>
                    <li>Instruction register and Decoder</li>
                    <li>Address bus and Data bus</li>
                    <li> Interrupt control
                    </li>
                    <li> Timing and Control unit</li>
                    <li> Address buffer and Address-Data buffer</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Accumulator :</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Accumulator is nothing but a register which can hold 8-bit data. 
                        Accumulator aids in storing two quantities. </li>
                    <li>The data to be processed by 
                        arithmetic and logic unit is stored in accumulator. </li>
                    <li>It also stores the result of the 
                        operation carried out by the Arithmetic and Logic unit.</li>
                    <li>The accumulator is also 
                        called an 8-bit register.</li>
                    <li>The accumulator can be used to send or receive 
                        data from the Internal Data bus.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Arithmetic and Logic Unit :</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>There is always a need to perform arithmetic operations like +, -, *, / and to 
                        perform logical operations like AND, OR, NOT etc. </li>
                    <li>So, there is a necessity for 
                        creating a separate unit which can perform such types of operations. </li>
                    <li>These 
                        operations are performed by the Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU). ALU 
                        performs these operations on 8-bit data. </li>
                    <li>But these operations cannot be 
                        performed unless we have an input (or) data on which the desired operation is 
                        to be performed.</li>
                    <li>After processing the necessary operations, the result is 
                        stored back in accumulator.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>General Purpose Registers:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Apart from accumulator 8085 consists of six special types of registers called 
                        General Purpose Registers. </li>
                    <li> These general-purpose registers are used to hold 
                        data like any other registers. The general-purpose registers in 8085 processors 
                        are B, C, D, E, H and L.</li>
                    <li>Each register can hold 8-bit data. Apart from the above 
                        function these registers can also be used to work in pairs to hold 16-bit data. </li>
                    <li>They can work in pairs such as B-C, D-E and H-L to store 16-bit data. </li>
                    <li>The H-L 
                        pair works as a memory pointer. A memory pointer holds the address of a 
                        particular memory location. They can store 16-bit address as they work in pair.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Program Counter :</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Program counter</b> is a special purpose register.</li>
                    <li>Consider that an instruction is being executed by processor. As soon as the 
                        ALU finished executing the instruction, the processor looks for the next 
                        instruction to be executed. So, there is a necessity for holding the address of the 
                        next instruction to be executed in order to save time. </li>
                    <li>This is taken care by the 
                        program counter. A program counter stores the address of the next instruction 
                        to be executed.</li>
                    <li>Microprocessor increments the program whenever an instruction is being 
                        executed, so that the program counter points to the memory address of the next 
                        instruction that is going to be executed.</li>
                    <li> Program counter is a 16-bit register.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Stack Pointer :</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Stack pointer</b> is also a 16-bit register which is used as a memory pointer. A 
                        stack is nothing but the portion of RAM</li>
                    <li>Stack pointer maintains the address of the last byte that is entered into 
                        stack.</li>
                    <li>Each time when the data is loaded into stack, Stack pointer gets 
                        decremented. Conversely it is incremented when data is retrieved from stack.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Temporary Register :</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>As the name suggests this register acts as a temporary memory during the 
                        arithmetic and logical operations.</li>
                    <li> Unlike other registers, this temporary 
                        register can only be accessed by the microprocessor.</li>
                    <li>it is completely 
                        inaccessible to programmers. </li>
                    <li>Temporary register is an 8-bit register.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Flags :</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Flags are nothing but a group of individual Flip-flops.</li>
                    <li>The flags are mainly 
                        associated with arithmetic and logic operations.</li>
                    <li>The flags will show either a 
                        logical (0 or 1) (i.e.) a set or reset depending on the data conditions in 
                        accumulator or various other registers.</li>
                    <li> A flag is actually a latch which can hold 
                        some bits of information.</li>
                    <li>It alerts the processor that some event has taken 
                        place.</li>
                    <li>Intel processors have a set of 5 flags :</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Carry flags</li>
                        <li>Parity flags</li>
                        <li> Auxiliary carry flag</li>
                        <li>Zero flags</li>
                        <li>Sign flags</li>
                    </ol>
                </ul>
                <h2>Instruction Register and Decoder:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Instruction register is 8-bit register just like every other register of 
                        microprocessor.</li>
                    <li>The instruction may be anything like 
                        adding two data's, moving a data, copying a data etc.</li>
                    <li>. When such an instruction 
                        is fetched from memory, it is directed to Instruction register. So, the instruction 
                        registers are specifically to store the instructions that are fetched from 
                        memory</li>
                    <li>There is an Instruction decoder which decodes the information
                        present in the Instruction register for further processing.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Timing and Control Unit:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Timing and control unit is a very important unit as it synchronizes the 
                        registers and flow of data through various registers and other units.</li>
                    <li>This unit 
                        consists of an oscillator and controller sequencer which sends control signals 
                        needed for internal and external control of data and other units. </li>
                    <li>The oscillator 
                        generates two-phase clock signals which aids in synchronizing all the registers 
                        of 8085 microprocessor.</li>
                    <li><b>Control Signals:</b> RD', WR', ALE </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li> ALE is used for provide control signal to synchronize the 
                            components of microprocessor and timing for instruction to 
                            perform the operation.</li>
                        <li> RD (Active low) and WR (Active low) are used to indicate whether 
                            the operation is reading the data from memory or writing the data 
                            into memory respectively</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><b>DMA Signals:</b> HOLD, HLDA, READY</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li> HOLD: Indicates that another master is requesting the use of the 
                            address and data buses.</li>
                        <li>HLDA: Indicates that the CPU has received the 
                            HOLD request and that it will relinquish the bus in the next clock 
                            cycle HLDA goes low after the Hold request is removed.</li>
                        <li> READY: This signal synchronizes the fast CPU and the slow memory, 
                            peripherals. If READY is high during a read or write cycle, it 
                            indicates that the memory or peripheral is ready to send or receive data.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><b>Reset Signals:</b> Reset in, Reset Out</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>RESET IN : Sets the program counter to zero (0000H),Resets the interrupt enables and HLDA flip-flops and tri-states the data bus, address bus and control bus.
                            </li>
                        <li> RESET OUT: This active high signal indicates that the processor; is 
                            being reset. This signal is synchronized to the processor clock and it 
                            can be used to reset other devices connected in the system.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <h2>Interrupt control :</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>As the name suggests this control interrupts a process.</li>
                    <li>Consider that a 
                        microprocessor is executing the main program. Now whenever the interrupt 
                        signal is enabled or requested the microprocessor shifts the control from main 
                        program to process the incoming request and after the completion of request, 
                        the control goes back to the main program.</li>
                    <li>Interrupt signals present in 8085 are :</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>INTR</li>
                        <li>RST 7.5</li>
                        <li>RST 6.5</li>
                        <li>RST 5.5</li>
                        <li>TRAP</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><b>INTR</b> is maskable 8080A compatible interrupt.When the interrupt occurs 
                        the processor fetches from the bus one instruction, usually one of these 
                        instructions: One of the 8 RST instructions (RST0 - RST7). </li>
                    <li><b>RST5.5</b> is a maskable interrupt. When this interrupt is received the 
                        processor saves the contents of the PC register into stack and branches to 2CH

                <h2>Serial Input/output control :</h2>
                <p>The input and output of serial data can be carried out using 2 instructions 
                    in 8085:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>SID-Serial Input Data</li>
                    <li>SOD-Serial Output Data</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Two more instructions are used to perform serial-parallel conversion 
needed for serial I/O devices:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>SIM</li>
                    <li>RIM</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Address bus and Data bus:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>We know that 8085 is an 8-bit microprocessor. So, the data bus present in 
                        the microprocessor is also 8-bits wide.</li>
                    <li>But 8085 processor requires 16-bit address bus 
                        as the memory addresses are 16-bit wide.</li>
                    <li>The 8 most significant bits of the 
                        address are transmitted with the help of address bus and the 8 least significant 
                        bits are transmitted with the help of multiplexed address/data bus.</li>
                    <li>The eight-bit data bus is multiplexed with the eight least significant bits of address bus.</li>
                    <li>The address/data bus is time multiplexed. This means for few microseconds, 
                        the 8 least significant bits of address are generated, while for next few seconds 
                        the same pin generates the data. This is called Time multiplexing.</li>
                    <li> ALE signal holds the obtained address in its latch for a long time until the 
                        data is obtained and so when the microprocessor sends the data next time the 
                        address is also available at the output latch. This technique is called 
                        Address/Data demultiplexing.</li>
